She wanted ideas for what to write in he paper where I told her I am unable to write it for her and that I am not versed in business so I could only help with writing. We read each section of her paper out loud, stopping while she fixed errors and sentence structure. We re read them back to ensure they made sense. She will book another session as she needs. "

He was already comfortable with basic compositions, and he wanted some practice with multiple layers of composition. We spoke about the order to substitute in functions, and we came up with a couple of practice functions to use. Once we worked through the process once going step-by-step, he had a solid understanding and was comfortable working on his own. We then moved on to decomposing functions by identifying functions inside of other functions, as well as looking for repeated elements of the function that we could extract as the inside function. Once we covered two examples, he was comfortable with decomposing, but still needed more practice."
