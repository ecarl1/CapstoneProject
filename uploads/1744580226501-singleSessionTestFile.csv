We started by reviewing some of the questions that he had already completed but not fully understood, and then moved on to reviewing the concepts and approaches he should use to do some of the problems he had not yet completed. We went over the definition of a function and the domain and range of a function. As we went over concepts, he would occasionally take a moment to do some of the problems on his own, but was running into difficulty with using point-slope form, interval notation, and adding fractions, so I made a bunch of my own practice problems so we could work on those topics together instead. By the end of the appointment, he had a better understanding of the material from the assignment."

Student sees unsure of where to start. I tried to help start noticing patterns and explained that some of the reactions she would have to just memorize. Student seemed a little more confident about the reactions after the session. I told the student that she should meet with the professor to help understand the professors notes and what is expected of her.
